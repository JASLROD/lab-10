Person
- name: String
+ CURRENT_YEAR: int //set to 2025 (Is final and static)

+ Person () //name set to “No name yet”
+ Person (name:String) 
+ setName (name:String): void
+ getName (): String
+ toString(): String // Prints out Name: <name field>





Use the Person class to create an Employee class that extends Person. 
Employee has two private instance variables: 
(1) an integer called hireYear and 
(2) a String called idNum. 
It will be necessary to create two constructors. 
The no-arg constructor calls super() and 
sets hireYear to 0 and idNum to Onboarding. 
The other constructor accepts three arguments - 
a String for name, 
an int for hireYear, and 
a String for idNum. 
You will need to create two public methods 
equals(Object o) and 
getServiceYears(). 
getServiceYears() subtracts hireYear from CURRENT_YEAR. 
NOTE CURRENT_YEAR is accessible to Person and all classes with an is-a relationship with 
Person (all the other classes).
